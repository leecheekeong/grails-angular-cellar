<h2>Demo 1</h2>
Basic demo ported to AngularJS 1.0.1 to run on Grails 1.3.7 with the JAXRS plugin (0.5-m1).
I added the Reload List button to refresh the Wine List.
<br/>
Note: using the JAXRS plugin I noticed that the first time you save a record, the listing does
not show the newly added record even though it has been correctly saved in the database.

<h2>Demo 2</h2>
In this version, we use only 1 controller and all the templates are load in. No routing is used.
Also, I use a Message box/display to error message and alerts.

<h2>Demo 3</h2>
For this version, I use dynamic template loading and I will show one template at a time (listing or editing).

<h2>Demo 4</h2>
For the final version, I modify the JAXRS component to return error messages which the
Angular JS page will display on the page.  I also added the Angular checking to ensure that
the required field has been filled in before saving.  This requires changes to the JAXRS
Resource files within the Grails application.
